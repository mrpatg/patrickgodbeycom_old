  So I've been chugging away at learning react as I go, editing this site
  getting it to look a certain way (mainly devoid of much style and very bland,
  like myself).

  - blog
  - react

I have had to re-do the navigation, found a [react-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) port, and searched out, and utilized my first npm plugin, [gatsby-plugin-favicon](https://github.com/Creatiwity/gatsby-plugin-favicon), to automatically generate my favicon stuff. 

Learning curve aside, I have to say, this has been a very rewarding and fun experience. I look forward to continuing to learn here.
